Battlecode 2015, Team holy

Follow the main instructions to install Battlecode2015 in some location.
Then set it up with eclipse as dictated in the instructions:

Update to Eclipse 4.2 or higher if you have not done so already. After you have installed the software, open Eclipse and choose "File" -> "New" -> "Project..." and choose "Java Project from Existing Ant Buildfile". Navigate to the build.xml in your install folder and use this one. Name your project, or leave it as the default and click 'Link to build file in the filesystem' and click 'Finish'. 

To run it, press the green play button with the box on it.
This repo takes the place of the "teams" directory, so delete the original one and clone this repo into its location with something like:

git clone https://github.com/jefesaurus/bc15.git teams

Style

Somewhat aribtrarily, indentations should be 2 spaces.
Set this manually, or import the eclipse format file I've included in teams/style.xml
Right click the project and go to properties->java code style->formatter->import->styles.xml
And then select ayylmao
